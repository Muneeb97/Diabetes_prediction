# Diabetes_prediction
This notebook basically goes through the process of training a linear classifier and a dense neural network classifier to predict if the person has diabetes or not according to certain variables and data. With both models having a rather similar evaluation metrics, we can choose either model. You can play around with the model features to get different results.


The data was processed before training the model and some visualized to show some certain variables and results of our model training

# Diabetes_prediction
&lt;h5>This notebook basically goes through the process of training a linear classifier and a dense neural network classifier to predict if the person has diabetes or not according to certain variables and data. With both models having a rather similar evaluation metrics, we can choose either model. You can play around with the model features to get different results.
